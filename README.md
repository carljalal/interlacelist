# interlacelist
this takes a single column txt or csv files of words and interleaves them

run the .exe in the same directory which you want to interleave all .txt or .csv files!
be careful! it will do it for all files that have .txt or .csv as an extension!

this is a c++ project and one of my first on github so please enjoy it in any way that you find use!!
